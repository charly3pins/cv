# Carles Fust√© Bertran, Curriculum Vitae

[[*Here's the last resume in PDF.*]](Carles-Fuste_CTO.pdf)

Also, there is a shortest version [here](Carles-Fuste_Software-Engineer.pdf). Both PDFs are created with Chrome with all the extras disabled and have been tested to ensure they contain transferable fonts.

This resume is built from a YAML file [me.yaml](me.yaml) and generated using Go templates [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template).

To generate the `resume.html` file used to render the resume in a browser, you can run from the root directory:

```go
go run main.go
```
